Description: Development headers for libentity
 Provides a libray for serialising/deserialising objects 
 using formats such as JSON. It provides a simple tree structure
 but more importantly it supports a method to directly map a C++
 class or structure to a tree which thereby allows direct 
 serialisation/deserialisation.
